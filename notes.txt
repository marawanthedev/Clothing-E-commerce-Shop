react components doesnt re-render unless it has recieved a new prop
which means that modifying an exisiting redux prop will no re-render the component
but only when creating a new prop object which is going to have some of the prev object data 
along with the modified data and then pass it as a prop only then ti will percieved as a new prop
not a modified prop which is gonna cause the component to re-render as expected
